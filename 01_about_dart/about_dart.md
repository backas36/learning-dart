- Dart is a type-safe language
- Dart is a platform-independent language and supports almost every operating system such as windows, mac, and Linux.
- Dart is an object-oriented programming language and supports all oops features such as encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, interface, etc.
- Dart comes with a dart2js compiler which translates dart code to javascript code that runs on all modern browsers.
- sound type system
  - Dart has static type check (compile time) and runtime check 
  - static type check will ignore dynamic type data
- type inference
  - types are mandatory, but don't have to be annotated 
  - because Dart can infer types by using the var keyword
  - dynamic VS. var
    - var isn't a type.
    - use `var` for type inference and `dynamic` for explicit flexibility.
    - `var` Uses automatic type inference, and the type assigned is immutable; it guarantees type correctness at compile time.
    - `dynamic` Explicitly indicates that the variable's type is flexible allowing the type change at runtime; however, due to the lack of static type checking, it may lead to runtime errors.

- Sound Null Safety
  - variables can't contain null, unless you say they can.
  - data can be nullable or non-nullable
- Dart using JIT, AOT compiler
  - JIT, just in time 
    - JIT compiles only the amount of code it needs
    - JIT doesn't recompile the already compiled code if it hasn't changed.
    - JIT is responsible for hot-reload
    - JIT doesn't transform the Dart Code into Machine Code, but rather into an Intermediary Language (for faster development cycles)
  - AOT, ahead of time compiler
    - compiles the entire code, it does this just before each build
    - AOT compiles the code into platform specific machine code
    - AOT makes sure the build is the best most optimal version of it
